A dx12 game engine (kind of).

This is my attempt to a dx12 engine, this is my third iteration to a so called engine. 
My first one was a poor Opengl viewport, then a more serious approach to a dx11 engine, but mostly geared toward getting stuff on screen quickly. 
Finally this is my third attempt trying to use dx12. 

It is my pleasure to introduce you to Sir Engine, the 3rd of his name.

Here a I will keep a chronological list of the progress:

***0.1.0***
