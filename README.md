A dx12 game engine (kind of).

This is my attempt to a dx12 engine, this is my third iteration to a so called engine. My first was a poor Opengl viewport, then a more serious approach to a dx11 engine. Finally this is my third attempt trying to use dx12. 

It is my pleasure to introduce you to Sir Engine, the 3rd of his name.
